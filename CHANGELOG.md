### Breaking Changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This update requires users to reconfigure their Turnkey credentials:

- The `TURNKEY_PRIVATE_KEY_ID` field has been replaced with `SIGN_WITH`
- Existing users will need to re-enter their credentials in the Settings screen
- If you were using a private key ID before, you can enter the same value in the `SIGN_WITH` field

### Network Configuration

#### Custom RPC Endpoints
```
base: https://mainnet.base.org
base-sepolia: https://sepolia.base.org
```

#### Block Explorer URLs
- Base Mainnet: https://basescan.org/
- Base Sepolia: https://sepolia.basescan.org/
- (Plus all existing Etherscan, Polygonscan, Arbiscan, etc.)

### Migration Instructions

See [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) for detailed migration instructions.

### Backwards Compatibility

The `SIGN_WITH` parameter accepts the same private key IDs that were used with `TURNKEY_PRIVATE_KEY_ID`, ensuring backwards compatibility for existing users who want to continue using their private key IDs.

### Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Production Ready | Notes |
|----------|--------|------------------|-------|
| iOS | ‚úÖ Supported | ‚úÖ Yes | Full features with secure keychain |
| Android | ‚úÖ Supported | ‚úÖ Yes | Full features with secure keychain |
| Web | ‚úÖ Supported | ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing only | localStorage (not encrypted) |

### Future Enhancements

Potential future additions:

- Custom RPC endpoint configuration
- Enhanced transaction history for Base networks
- Web-specific security improvements (Passkeys, iframe embedding)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support
- Session-based authentication for web
